Hello! 
In a world where technology is unrelentingly accelerating the lives of many, the elderly often find themselves incapable of effectively managing daily technological tasks—from the basic to the complex—on their smartphones due to a myriad of reasons: unfamiliarity with modern interfaces, cognitive limitations, physical constraints and even a fear of technology. The Digital Literacy Assistant is a software designed as pop-up so that it occupies a small portion of your smartphone (typically a corner) and aids you in performing your daily smartphone tasks in a user-friendly way. It can work both online and offline and allows users to input various questions like “how to set a new password” and provides helpful, detailed instructions to effectively answer their concerns. In addition, a threat detection feature is implemented in the software to help the elderly ward of potential scammers that may lurk in their emails and text messages. The Digital Literacy Assistant is the ideal companion for the elderly—especially those who live alone—in the technological world of today.
